“Hey there!  I’m an AeroAstro PhD student interested in using distributed satellite cameras to detect and track spacecraft and debris in low Earth orbit.  When I’m not in lab, I like throwing parties, making cocktails, and doing tricks on my skateboard—sometimes successfully.  I joined dREFS because I want students in this department to feel welcome in their research labs and appreciated in their interactions with their advisors.  I’m fortunate to have a great relationship with my PI, and I want to propagate that through the rest of the department.  So, if you need someone to talk to, I’m here to listen, and if you’re feeling lost in space, I’ll be your GPS.”
