The AeroAstro dREFS are graduate students trained in conflict management. You can contact an individual dREF directly or find us all at [aeroastro-refs@mit.edu](mailto:aeroastro-refs@mit.edu). If you are interested in joining the team, contact us at [aeroastro-refs@mit.edu](mailto:aeroastro-refs@mit.edu) for information about training. If you are interested in our organizational structure, you can read our [constitution](https://aarefs.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/aeroastro-drefs-constitution.pdf).
