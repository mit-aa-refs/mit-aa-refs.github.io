"Hi! I’m an AeroAstro graduate student with an advisor and lab group in MechE. My research area is nanophotonics, optics, and metamaterials with applications in solar and thermal energy generation. I really like running along the Charles and up in the Middlesex Fells trails. I also love playing guitar and having conversations over coffee. As a dREFS I’m here and available to discuss any points of stress or anxiety about grad school or life in that context!"

* Languages: English, Hindi, Malayalam

"Hi! I’m a graduate student in AeroAstro working on safe planning and fair decision-making for multi-agent robots. In my spare time, I love to read and learn about new technologies, and their potential impact on society. Some of my newest hobbies are knitting, playing board games with friends and learning new languages. I love having conversations with people about any topic and I'm committed to supporting my fellow graduate students. As a dREFS, I'm always available and approachable, willing to help with any questions or concerns"

"Hey there!  I’m an AeroAstro PhD student interested in using distributed satellite cameras to keep track of all of the tiny pieces of debris in low Earth orbit.  When I’m not in lab, I enjoy exploring Boston, meeting new people, trying new things, hosting parties, crafting cocktails, and doing tricks on my skateboard—sometimes successfully.  I joined dREFS because I want students in this department to feel welcome in their research labs and appreciated in their interactions with their advisors.  I’m fortunate to have a great relationship with my PI, and I want to propagate that through the rest of the department.  So, if you need someone to talk to, I’m here to listen, and if you need to navigate a difficult situation, I’ll be your GPS."

"Hi! I’m a graduate student in AeroAstro currently working on an air-dropped ice penetrator to deliver seismometers to Antarctic ice shelves. I’m interested in waves, remote sensing, electrical systems, circuits and space systems. I also enjoy practicing cello, hiking long distances and cooking for my housemates. I’m enthused to support graduate students navigating advisor relations, thesis writing and anything else you’d like to discuss."
