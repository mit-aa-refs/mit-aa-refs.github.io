The AeroAstro dREFS are graduate students trained in conflict management. You can contact an individual dREF directly or find us all at [aeroastro-refs@mit.edu](mailto:aeroastro-refs@mit.edu). If you are interested in joining the team, contact us at [aeroastro-refs@mit.edu](mailto:aeroastro-refs@mit.edu) for information about training. If you are interested in our organizational structure, you can read our [constitution](https://aarefs.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/aeroastro-drefs-constitution.pdf).

"Hi! I’m a graduate student in AeroAstro working on safe planning and fair decision-making for multi-agent robots. In my spare time, I love to read and learn about new technologies, and their potential impact on society. Some of my newest hobbies are knitting, playing board games with friends and learning new languages. I love having conversations with people about any topic and I'm committed to supporting my fellow graduate students. As a dREFS, I'm always available and approachable, willing to help with any questions or concerns"

"Hey there!  I’m an AeroAstro PhD student interested in using distributed satellite cameras to keep track of all of the tiny pieces of debris in low Earth orbit.  When I’m not in lab, I enjoy exploring Boston, meeting new people, trying new things, hosting parties, crafting cocktails, and doing tricks on my skateboard—sometimes successfully.  I joined dREFS because I want students in this department to feel welcome in their research labs and appreciated in their interactions with their advisors.  I’m fortunate to have a great relationship with my PI, and I want to propagate that through the rest of the department.  So, if you need someone to talk to, I’m here to listen, and if you need to navigate a difficult situation, I’ll be your GPS."

"Hi! I’m a graduate student in AeroAstro currently working on an air-dropped ice penetrator to deliver seismometers to Antarctic ice shelves. I’m interested in waves, remote sensing, electrical systems, circuits and space systems. I also enjoy practicing cello, hiking long distances and cooking for my housemates. I’m enthused to support graduate students navigating advisor relations, thesis writing and anything else you’d like to discuss."

“Hello hello hello! I am a PhD student interested in graph neural networks and game theoretic design for space traffic management. I love trail running, ice climbing, and going to drag shows. I joined dREFS because I’m passionate about student wellbeing, and I believe everyone should have the tools and support they need to succeed in graduate school.  My path to my current advisor was a little rocky and nontraditional, so I’m happy to chat about advising issues and what it’s like to switch advisors. As a dREFS, I’m here to listen and support other graduate students through any problems that you’re dealing with at MIT!”

“Hello! I’m delighted to be part of the aero astro department because of all the great people I get to know – people like you. Before coming back to MIT for my PhD, I worked for two years, and, while I learned a lot of technical skills during that time, I also found out more about myself and how much I missed my time in school. All this to say that I’m happy to be here and want to make sure that I can enable everyone else to feel respected, happy, and empowered to do what they want.”
