The AeroAstro dREFS are graduate students trained in conflict management. dREFS can help in multiple different ways. Below, we’ve listed some of the ways we have helped people in the past, but if we haven’t listed what you’re looking for, please feel free to reach out with any questions you have.

**We can help directly:**
The AeroAstro dREFS are graduate students like you. If you’re struggling with an advisor, trying to balance classes and research, or just want to talk through your current thoughts, we are here to listen. You can [reach out to all dREFS](mailto:aeroastro-refs@mit.edu) or to any of the individuals listed on the [“Who we are” page](../who-we-are).

**Referral to other resources:**
Just like people reaching out to dREFS for help with a problem, sometimes dREFS rely on other, more specialized resources at MIT that can help us out. Below, we’ve listed some of the resources available to graduate students; a more exhaustive list can be found at [doingwell.mit.edu](http://doingwell.mit.edu). If this seems overwhelming, don’t worry; you can always just come to us and we’ll discuss what other resources you might want to consider.
